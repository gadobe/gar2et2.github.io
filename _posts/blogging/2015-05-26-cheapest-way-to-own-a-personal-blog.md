Having an online profile is often mentioned as one of the best ways to stand out of the crowd. Free options are abundant: Wordpress, Tumbler and on the flip-side premium solution might cost more than $100/year. Here are three ways that enable you to have your own .com with a personal site/blog attached to it.

## Wordpress.com $24/year

Wordpress.com's online offering is a good way to start off. It is free to start with and you'll get a yoursite.wordpress.com address. For the extra $24/year you can purchase your own custom domain within the interface.
The only limitations are:

<p>* limited space of 3GB</p>
<p>* may show ads</p>
<p>* cannot use custom themes</p>

More pricing packages [here][1].

## Blogger.com ~$12/year

Google's Blogger or Blogspot is a viable option. The bandwidth and diskspace is unlimited and the interface is by far the simplest. Most themes are free as well although overall, Wordpress have better looking themes. The free offering gives you a youtsite.blogpost.com, you can then purchase a domain at your domain provider. My preferred choice is [VentraIP][2] because:

<p>* it's an Australian company and that should mean better support</p>
<p>* their servers are in Australia, so changes are propagated faster (from observation)</p>
<p>* the domain control panel is accessible and offers free email forwarding (any email youriste.com can be forwarded for free)</p>


## Github pages ~$12/year

The third option is what I am using for this blog. This option requires some html/css knowledge. I am currently using [Jekyll][3] which is a static html generator with a theme. With my background in IT, it is fairly simple to use. There is also a lot of documentation online to facilitate the learning of it. The bandwidth and disk space is generous for the purpose of a personal blog/profile. Again, the only cost is to purchase a domain as above.
